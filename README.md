## Introduction: a brief information about the project.
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

## Design statement:
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 
Hawaii is a state that is booming with tourism. While visitors come thousands of miles to the Aloha state, most of them know very little about where to visit and what events to attend to optimize their experience. Smart Trip is a feature on Hawaii's state website that provides popular travelling recommendations to visitors of Hawaii.
