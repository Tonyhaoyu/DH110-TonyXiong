# Hawaiian Experience from a Civil and Recreational Standpoint

## Assignement 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Tony Xiong | DH110 | Fall 2021

### Project Overview:
Hawaii is a fun state. While travel and recreations are some of the biggest source of reputation and income for the state, the designs of Hawaii's official websites lack many elements that highlight the strenghts of these divisions. In this assignment, I am going to explore different aspects of Hawaii's website from the standpoint of the Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation and the Department of Human Resources Development, as well as conducting a heuristic evaluation on these two divisions. I will primarily adhere to Nielson's 10 rules of heuristics in my evaluation. As a result, I will be able to identify the strenghts and weaknesses of Hawaii's official websites and offer suggestions that could contribute to an improvement in the website's visuals, intuitiveness, and experience.

### Severity Ratings - Nielsen Norman Group:

0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all

1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project

2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority

3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released

## Website 1: Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation

Link to the website: https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dobor/

The Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation strives to preserve Hawaii's natural and cultural resources and also providing access of these resources to residents and visitors. Many recreational activities, including boating and surfing, are under the juristiction of this division.

Overall Evaluation: The website for the Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation is standard looking, but also information, as it does not contain fancy animations and avant garde styles. However, this could be a negative attribute for a division that is directly in charge of oceanic recreation. The frontpage presents 5 dropdown menus as well as multiple button that would navigate users to different pages, which could be useful and confusing at the same time. Most pages adopt a left-right structure, having a column that goes straight down, which takes up 1/3 of the entire page on the right. This could be distracting visually, as it skews the balance of the website's layout, making visitors lose focus.
