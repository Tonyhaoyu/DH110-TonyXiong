## Introduction

Hawaii.gov is the official website for the state of Hawaii. Its division of Boating and Oceanic Recreation, which is the main subject of this case of usability testing, oversees preservation and the entertainment activities regarding the natural and cultural resources of Hawaii.

A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a user’s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site. 

Tony Xiong, a student of DH110, conducted an online usability test of the website for Hawaii's division of Boating and Oceanic Recreation via Zoom. This is a pilot testing session aimed to test the settings and the materials for future usability tests. There was only one participant. The application captured the participant's face, comments, and navigation choices. The sesseion was conducted in the rooms of the participant and the test administrator respectively, where a stable wifi connection and a quiet environment was achieved. The session captured the participant’s navigational choices, task completion rates, comments, overall satisfaction ratings, questions and feedback.

## Methodology
The test administrator contacted and recruited the participant from his list of contacts. The test administrator sent a briefing of this usability test to the participate, informing him of the test logistics and requesting his availability and participation. The participant responded with an appropriate date and time. 
The session lasted approximately 30 minutes.

The survey was conducted using Google Form, which the participant filled out with the guidance of the test administrator. The whole process is divided into roughly three sections: the pre-test phase, the testing, and the post-test phase. The pre-testing phase covers information regarding the usability testing itself as well as how the testing would be conducted. Then, the participant is asked to complete 3 tasks that are essential to the functioning of Hawaii's division of Boating and Oceanic Recreation and fill out the respective questions. After this, the participant would complete the post-test survey followed by some personal questions. The entirety of this process would be recorded, except for the personal questions. This is done using Zoom's built in camera, which would capture the participant and his screen.

## Reflection
This test piloting session offered great insight into the structure of the website for Hawaii's Division of Boating and Oceanic Recreation. It also provided me with a better understanding of the usability testing process. Many things went well for this usability testing session, including the recording, the moderation, the screen sharing, etc. The participant was especially engaged in the process, which made the session proceed smoothly. However, during two parts of the usability test, my internet connection broke, resulting in short disconnect between me and the participant. The issue was quickly fixed after the second occurence. This experience overall familiarized me with the usability testing process. I learned that the test administrator needs to be neutral but also to be understanding of the situation. For instance, when the participant was having trouble completing task 2, I had to restrain myself from giving hints, but also to be empathetic of the participant and telling him to move on to the next task without hurting his feelings. In addition, I also learned a lot about the website iteself. Most notably, the participant failed to complete any steps for task 2, which is to find the weather reports. The fact that such an important task could not be completed with ease shows a huge room for improvements for the website. For usability tests in the future, I would pay more attention to the setup to make sure an internet failure wold not happen. I would also ask the participant more questions so they could flush out their thoughts while completing the tasks.
