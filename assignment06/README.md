# DH 110 Assignment 06 - Interface Design
Tony Xiong | DH 110 | Fall 2021

## Summary
The purpose of this interface design assignment is to identify and solidify the design style, including the typography, the shapes, and the colors for the new feature we proposed. By doing this interface design and conducting an impression test, I can pick out appropriate designs to apply on the entire feature I proposed. For this interface design, I picked the "visitor" page for the feature "trip planner" since it has relatively more design elements than the other pages. In addition, it also shares similar structure with most of the other pages for trip planner, which makes it a good choice for this interface deisgn assignment.
