# Hawaiian Experience from a Civil and Recreational Standpoint

## Assignement 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Tony Xiong | DH110 | Fall 2021

### Project Overview:
Hawaii is a fun state. While travel and recreations are some of the biggest source of reputation and income for the state, the designs of Hawaii's official websites lack many elements that highlight the strenghts of these divisions. In this assignment, I am going to explore different aspects of Hawaii's website from the standpoint of the Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation and the Department of Human Resources Development, as well as conducting a heuristic evaluation on these two divisions. I will primarily adhere to Nielson's 10 rules of heuristics in my evaluation. As a result, I will be able to identify the strenghts and weaknesses of Hawaii's official websites and offer suggestions that could contribute to an improvement in the website's visuals, intuitiveness, and experience.

### Severity Ratings - Nielsen Norman Group:

1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project

2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority

3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

## Website 1: Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation

Link to the website: https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dobor/

The Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation strives to preserve Hawaii's natural and cultural resources and also providing access of these resources to residents and visitors. Many recreational activities, including boating and surfing, are under the juristiction of this division.

Overall Evaluation: The website for the Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation is standard looking, but also information, as it does not contain fancy animations and avant garde styles. However, this could be a negative attribute for a division that is directly in charge of oceanic recreation. The frontpage presents 5 dropdown menus as well as multiple button that would navigate users to different pages, which could be useful and confusing at the same time. Most pages adopt a left-right structure, having a column that goes straight down, which takes up 1/3 of the entire page on the right. This could be distracting visually, as it skews the balance of the website's layout, making visitors lose focus.

##### 1. Visibility of System Status

While the website provides the most basic forms of visibility cues, these cues are not done effectively, and sometimes completely omitted. In addition, when a user types in the search bar, a list of suggestions does not appear, rendering this human-computer interaction less than ideal, as the user does not get a feedback from the system.

Suggestions: the website should incorporate more visual cues that informs the users of the validity of their actions. One example would be having a list of suggestions for a user search, effectively telling the user that the system is aware of their action, and is trying to make the process easier. The website should also avoid underlined texts, as 

##### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
The website often fails to distinguish between links and important notices. One common practice is having hyperlinks that are not underlined and plain texts that are underlined. This would confuse users, as they would mistaken call-to-actions with plain texts. It also does not align with implied internet rules, as underlines are usually associated with hyperlinks instead of texts.
