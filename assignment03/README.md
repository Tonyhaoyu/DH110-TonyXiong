## Step 01: Specify the research goal & requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The redesign of the website for Hawaii's Division of Boating and Oceanic Recreation would help improve the traveling experience to the state of Hawaii as well as the effectiveness of Hawaii's advocacy of its natural and artificial resources. The following research on user behavior, especially in the navigation aspect, would provide important information in regards to improving the intuitiveness of the website and the effectiveness of information delivery in future design processes.
### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, this activity would fulfill the users' cognitive needs since individuals who seek entertainment and fun in the form of traveling and experiencing nature would want to have the ability to identify possible tasks and choices. By finding which beach to surf or by renting a fishing boat would contribute to one's cognitive desires.
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Some traditional solutions finding efficiently navigating on websites including using the search bar, looking through obvious visual signs, and trying different call-to-action buttons. Since most websites are designed with differentiating characteristics, there are often more than one formula of navigation. For instance, some users might rely on built-in media, whereas others would stick to texts. Therefore, this assignment is crucial in understanding some of these behaviors.
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
As more frameworks and plugins are developed for websites, the overall experience of navigation would improve as a result. While most current search functions on websites simply list out all the findings with the inputted keywords, with machine learning and other technologies, it is possible that these searches would be optimized for a more personal experience. As a result of such technological improvement, website navigation would surely become more efficient, just like how websites today are significantly more intuitive than websites a decade ago.

## Step 02: Target users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 

## Step 03: Pick an qualitative research method
