Tony Xiong | DH110 | Fall 2021

#### Project Overview:
Hawaii is a fun state.

#### Severity Ratings:

0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all

1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project

2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority

3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released
