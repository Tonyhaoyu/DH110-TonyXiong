## Introduction

Link to the website: https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dobor/

Hawaii.gov is the official website for the state of Hawaii. Its division of Boating and Oceanic Recreation, which is the main subject of this case of usability testing, oversees preservation and the entertainment activities regarding the natural and cultural resources of Hawaii.

A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a user’s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site. 

Tony Xiong, a student of DH110, conducted an online usability test of the website for Hawaii's division of Boating and Oceanic Recreation via Zoom. This is a pilot testing session aimed to test the settings and the materials for future usability tests. There was only one participant. The application captured the participant's face, comments, and navigation choices. The sesseion was conducted in the rooms of the participant and the test administrator respectively, where a stable wifi connection and a quiet environment was achieved. The session captured the participant’s navigational choices, task completion rates, comments, overall satisfaction ratings, questions and feedback.

## Methodology
The test administrator contacted and recruited the participant from his list of contacts. The test administrator sent a briefing of this usability test to the participate, informing him of the test logistics and requesting his availability and participation. The participant responded with an appropriate date and time. 
The session lasted approximately 30 minutes. During the session, the test administrator explained the test session and asked the participant to fill out a brief background questionnaire (see Attachment A). Participants read the task scenarios and tried to find the information on the website.

After each task, the administrator asked the participant to rate the interface on a 7-point Likert Scale. Post-task scenario subjective measures included: 
- How easy it was to find the information from the home page.
- Ability to keep track of their location in the website.
- Accurateness of predicting which section of the website contained the information.

After the last task was completed, the test administrator asked the participant to rate the website overall by using a 7-point Likert scale for eight subjective measures including:
- Ease of use
- Frequency of use
- Difficulty to keep track of location in website
- Learn ability  
- how easy it would be for most users to learn to use the website
- Information facilitation – how quickly participant could find information
- Look & feel appeal – homepage’s content makes me want to explore the site further
- Site content – site’s content would keep me coming back 
- Site organization

In addition, the test administrator asked the participants the following overall website questions:
- What the participant liked most
- What the participant liked least
- Recommendations for improvement
