## Persona + Scenarios
### The Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is especially crucial to my project, as being able to identify with potential users and gain their perspectives would enhance the human-centered design experience of the product. By building user personas, I also clarify my own vision of how my product should deliver the most effective information. Since I am re-designing Hawaii's state website, it is important to eliminate any biases so that every user can equality enjoy the navigation process. Having journey maps also help me to clearly identify the users' problem and their actions towards the solution we offer.

## Scenario + Journey Map
### Feature 1 - Event Promotion (with Sam Peterson)
Event promotion allows individuals and organizations to post event information, including texts, posters, images, and videos for the public to view online. The end user can browse through a variety of events/promotions posted and directly contact the hosts via the contact information they provide. This feature is free.
### Why is Sam using this feature?
Sam, being a restauranteur in Hawaii, who is trying to promote a Hawaiian barbecue event for the publicity of his restaurant, he is in need for a convenient and effective method to reach more people. Since his restaurant is running low on cash, Sam can't afford billboards and online advertisements, but if he doesn't take any promotional actions, the profit he gains from the event would not be able to cover the cost. Therefore, the event promotion feature on Hawaii's state website would work perfectly with achieving his goal. Sam would not have to spend money since this feature is free to use, and he would also be able to save time for the actual planning and preparation fo the event.
### How is Sam using this feature?
This feature can be accessed through any smart device with an internet connection, such as a smartphone or a laptop. Sam would have to first fill out a form that asks for some basic information. He would input the name, the date, and the scale of the event, and his contact information, so that the website's algorithm can group Sam's event with other similar ones. Sam would then upload information about the event. He would post the posters, the schedule, or the list of attendees for the event. After Sam is done with this registration process, his event is officially posted. The website would then provide live updates to Sam's post. He would check to see how many people have viewed his post and respond to any relevent inquiries. When Sam discovers a mistake in his post or when there is an update to the event, he could edit his original post.
