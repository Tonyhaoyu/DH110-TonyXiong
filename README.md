# Hawaii Smart Trip
Tony Xiong

## Introduction
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.
Smart Trip is a feature on Hawaii's state website that provides popular travelling recommendations to visitors of Hawaii. Built on Hawaii's state website, as a part of their visitors' page, Smart Trip asks prospect travellers a few questions about their ideal trip to Hawaii, then provides them with a list of popular sites and events to visit based on their needs. This feature adopts a linear format, which makes the user flow intuitive and efficient. It is also user-friendly to visitors of all age groups.

## Design statement
Hawaii is a state that is booming with tourism. While visitors come thousands of miles to the Aloha state, most of them know very little about where to visit and what events to attend to optimize their experience. I hope that this feature could attract more tourists to Hawaii, which would result in both social and economic imporovements for the state. It is also a great way for Hawaii to introduce its own culture to people around the world.

## Competitor analysis
To better understand the functionality and flow of Hawaii's state website, I conducted a heuristics evaluation on Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation and the Department of Human Resources Development. I used Nielsen Norman's 10 principles of heuristics to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the website and its features. I discovered that even though Hawaii's state website is old-fashioned in its style, it does not sacrifice too much intuitiveness and have the right pieces in place for a markeover.

In addition to heuristics, I also conducted a user research, in which the participant followed my intructions to navigate around the webpage for Hawaii's Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation. I documented the event by screen recording via Zoom. I discovered that even though Hawaii's state website has a clear menu bar, the subsections are confusing for the user to navigate around and find information. The priority of features are also mixed up, which makes the website lack foucs.

## User research
In order to better understand user behavior, I conducted a contextual inquiry, combining observation with interview. I asked the participant to introduce me to two websites he frequents and the actions he make using these websites. I recorded both the interview and the observation study. The contextual was helpful in identifying users' needs for the design of the Smart Trip feature.

## UX storytelling
I designed three different user personas to better connect with potential users for my Smart Trip feature. Through UX storytelling, I was able to solidify my vision as well as the direction of the design. I drew empathy maps for all three personas, as they reveals the details of my potential users and how they might behave when they are using the feature I propose. Understanding their goals is also pivotal in designing the priority of different elements on the final product.

The layout, colors, and typefaces are also carefully designed for an optimized user experience.
