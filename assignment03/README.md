## Step 01: Specify the research goal & requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The redesign of the website for Hawaii's Division of Boating and Oceanic Recreation would help improve the traveling experience to the state of Hawaii as well as the effectiveness of Hawaii's advocacy of its natural and artificial resources. The following research on user behavior, especially in the navigation aspect, would provide important information in regards to improving the intuitiveness of the website and the effectiveness of information delivery in future design processes.
### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, this activity would fulfill the users' cognitive needs since individuals who seek entertainment and fun in the form of traveling and experiencing nature would want to have the ability to identify possible tasks and choices. By finding which beach to surf or by renting a fishing boat would contribute to one's cognitive desires.
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Some traditional solutions finding efficiently navigating on websites including using the search bar, looking through obvious visual signs, and trying different call-to-action buttons. Since most websites are designed with differentiating characteristics, there are often more than one formula of navigation. For instance, some users might rely on built-in media, whereas others would stick to texts. Therefore, this assignment is crucial in understanding some of these behaviors.
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
As more frameworks and plugins are developed for websites, the overall experience of navigation would improve as a result. While most current search functions on websites simply list out all the findings with the inputted keywords, with machine learning and other technologies, it is possible that these searches would be optimized for a more personal experience. As a result of such technological improvement, website navigation would surely become more efficient, just like how websites today are significantly more intuitive than websites a decade ago.

## Step 02: Target users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
Demographic: people who use websites often
Preference: people who enjoy traveling and who use online tools to help them plan their travel
Expertise: N/A
Mainstream vs extreme: mainstream users are preferred
### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity? 
People who browse online would inevitably use different navigation methods to find the information they want, and this process happens on a daily basis. For traveling purposes, especially those related to Hawaii, would come less often. Users might want to find ticket information, recreational information (surfing, boating, etc) and weather reports for satefy reasons.
### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
Users typically use a variety of methods to complete the navigation activity. Some of the most common ones including searching, which often involves typing keywords into search bars to find relevent information. Another approach users take is making educated guesses and clicking to see where the call-to-action takes them, and if they don't land on the right page or find the right information, they would try clicking somewhere else.

## Step 03: Pick an qualitative research method
Observation + interview is the main research method used in this study, where the participant would perform tasks at his own pace and answer questions posted by the moderator. The participant will first be asked some background questions for the moderator to gain a preliminary understanding of the user's preferences and behavior. The participant is then asked more specific questions that are unique to the web navigation process and perform tasks for the moderator to observe and take note. After completing these tasks, the participant is then asked follow-up questions. These steps make up the general structure of this study.
