# DH 110 Assignment 06 - Interface Design
Tony Xiong | DH 110 | Fall 2021

## Summary
The purpose of this interface design assignment is to identify and solidify the design style, including the typography, the shapes, and the colors for the new feature we proposed. By doing this interface design and conducting an impression test, I can pick out appropriate designs to apply on the entire feature I proposed. For this interface design, I picked the "visitor" page for the feature "trip planner" since it has relatively more design elements than the other pages. In addition, it also shares similar structure with most of the other pages for trip planner, which makes it a good choice for this interface deisgn assignment.

## Grid
I adopted horizontal grid as it fits the overall layout of the page I chose. I made adjustments based on the grid, which is 9 rows with a 20 gutter size.

## Typography
I experimented with three different typographies to see which one fits my style the most. The feel I was going for was "lively but also professional". The first font family I went with was Quicksand, which is a lean sans serif. However, it looked quite mundane and lacked the vividness I was looking for. I then used Rock Salt as my title font and Amarante for the body text. This was an improvement from the first attempt, but it was a bit too extravagant and users might find it too artistic. The third variation I chose was Ribeye for the title and Alice for the body text. This combination struck a very good balance between artistic appeal and professionalism. Hence, I settled on this typography and moved forward.

## Shape

Since the visitor page contained many buttons, I mostly experimented with the roundness of these buttons as well as the stroke type. I first dropped a shadow of 4 on the Y axis with a blur of 4 to highlight the buttons. I then made the buttons completely rounded, with 100 in roundness. Although the shadow worked well to draw attention to the buttons, the roundness lacked professionalism and almost looked cute. I toned down the roundness of the corners to 10, which yielded a better result. For my third design, I tried making the stroke of dotted, but it did not look professional enough and might not convey the message that these are indeed buttons. Therefore, I stuck with the second variation.

## Color
I made four variations in colors, including two for dark mode. I extracted some iconic colors from Hawaii's state emblem and applied them onto both of my daytime designs. However, since the first color scheme was too bright and lacked contrast, I went with the second one.

For the dark mode, I started with a dark background and white buttons design, which was recommanded by Google's material design guidelines. However, since the size of the buttons are quite large on the visitor page, practically taking up the entire screen, they might be too bright for the user's comfort. Therefore, in my second variation, I took away the white fill on the buttons and only kept the outline. Since it worked better in terms of both visual appeal and practicality, I moved forward with this second variation.

## Impression Test
Here are the two designs I used in the impression test:

I asked Emily Wang, who is a UX designer on one of the projects that I am currently working on for an immediate feedback on the designs that I presented. Here are some of the feedback she offered:

"I like it!"

"The design is a bit too simple...maybe you can add something in the background or like use different colors"
